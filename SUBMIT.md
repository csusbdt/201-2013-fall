# How to submit work

There are 2 ways that you can submit work in this course:
by email or by pushing into a remote Git repository.

Submitting work by email is the simple way to go.
However, if you want to prepare for a career as a software developer
or other computer science professional,
you should consider learning the Git version control system and
submit your work with it.

Also, if you submit your work via Git, you will receive 2 points
extra credit for each lab and assignment that you submit.
However, keep in mind that using Git requires significant extra study.
See [the optional instructions for setting up Git](https://github.com/csusbdt/centos/blob/master/GIT-SUBMISSION.md)
if you want to submit your work with Git.

## Email Submission

To submit work by email, send your files to
Christina Torres at torrc321@coyote.csusb.edu
and cc David Turner at dturner@csusb.edu.
Make sure you include your name and the assignment ID in the email message.

## Git Submission

After pushing your local repository to your remote repository,
notify Christina and me that you have submitted the assignment by Git.
Send this email notification to
Christina Torres at torrc321@coyote.csusb.edu
and cc David Turner at dturner@csusb.edu.
Make sure you include your name and the assignment ID in the email message.
Do not attach any files to your email;
we will access your work from the remote Git repository.
